# Day Planner

In this application, you can plan your day by filling in the text boxes in the appropriate time slot and saving the event. The events written in the text areas will be saved for your convenience and memory, even after you leave the page.

I added a "scrap day" button to wipe the slate clean, while also emptying local storage.

In order to write this application, I employed a mix of jQuery, Bootstrap 4, and Moment.js. Moment.js provided accurate seamless Time manipulation functionality while also providing methods to compare times. This allowed me to color the time blocks relative to the current time. Gray, red, and green are show to past, present, and future respectively.
